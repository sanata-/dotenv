AstroMac UI theme
=================

AstroMac UI theme for Atom.

Based on the amazing [Astronomical UI](https://github.com/LabLayers/astronomical-ui) with some elements taken from[Mac OS Theme](https://github.com/ericjbasti/mac-os) such as folder icons and a couple of other fairly small changes on the settings page.

All credit goes to those two amazing themes. I only made some small css changes because I liked both of them and I am stubborn.

- Square tabs
- Find/Pallete animations
- Close icon animations
- GitHub-inspired Settings page
- Sidebar subfolder highlighting on hover
- Sidebar doesn't change colors on inactivity
- Textboxes without borders
- And more!
- OSX Style Directory icons with git changed colors

This can be activated by going to the *Themes* section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the*UI Themes* drop-down menu.
