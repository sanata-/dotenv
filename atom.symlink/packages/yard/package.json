  "readme": "# YARD Generator (Atom package)\n\nYARD is a commonly used Ruby documentation tool. This package will accelerate\nthe creation of the YARD-style comments for your methods and classes.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use it is as simple as situating on a method and pressing `ctrl + enter`.\nThis will analyse the method params and generate the following snippet for the\ndocumentation:\n\n```\nclass UndocumentedClass\n  # Description of method\n  #\n  # @param [Type] param1 describe param1\n  # @param [Type] param2=3 describe param2=3\n  # @return [Type] description of returned object\n  def undocumented_method(param1, param2=3)\n    'The method is not documented!'\n  end\nend\n```\n\n`Tab`/`shift + Tab` keys could be used to jump to the next param, description or\nType.\n\n### Future\n\nI will update this package soon with more intelligence and features:\n* **Analyse better the method params.\n* **Implement for class.\n",
