## 1.2.0 - Added SplitDiff package for viewing revisions

Revisions were previously viewed ala git-history package style - now shows diffs with sync'd scrolling.  

Thank you @aaronbushnell for the suggestion and thanks to @mupchrch for the split-diff package which I use as an npm git+ dependency (nice code!).  


## 1.0.0 - First Release

This should have been 0.1.0, but I caught it a little late.  This was the initial public release.
